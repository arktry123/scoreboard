# scoreboard
 
 This application was developed using maven and Java 11.
 
 Please make sure that your IDE/Desktop supports the same. 
 
 Please follow the below steps to run and test the application:
 
 1) mvn clean install - to run the tests and create the application jar file. 
    It creates a Jar scorecard-0.0.1-SNPASHOT.jar under target folder.
 2) Use the below command to run the application: 
    java -jar scorecard*.jar 
 3) We can use postman to test the REST API.
 
 Note: The additional task of pushing messages was not done here. I have done some 
 googling about that and came across STOPM messaging. But not very confident about the same
, and hence left it as it is mentioned as an additional task. 

PS: have done the commit all at once. I would normally do many commits - as and when a specific functionality works fine.
